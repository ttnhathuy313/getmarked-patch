A student cut some cubes (1 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm) from a beetroot and washed them in running water for 20 minutes. The cubes were then put into test tubes containing distilled water and alcohol of different concentrations (W, X, Y and Z) for 30 minutes. The table below shows the colour intensity of the solutions after 30 minutes.</div> </div>",
