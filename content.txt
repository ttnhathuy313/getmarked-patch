Directions
: The following two questions refer to the investigation below. Beetroot cells contain a red pigment in the vacuoles. A student cut some cubes (1 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm) from a beetroot and washed them in running water for 20 minutes. The cubes were then put into test tubes containing distilled water and alcohol of different concentrations (W, X, Y and Z) for 30 minutes. The table below shows the colour intensity of the solutions after 30 minutes.

Which of the following is/are correct explanation(s) of the experimental results?
(1) The phospholipids in the cell membrane dissolve in alcohol.
(2) The pigment molecules are non-polar and thus can move across the phospholipid bilayer.
(3) Carrier proteins are present on the cell membrane of the beetroot cells to transport the pigment molecules.
A
 (1) only
B
 (2) only
C
 (1) and (2) only
D
 (1), (2) and (3)
Ans: A
