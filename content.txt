Directions
: The following two questions refer to the investigation below. Beetroot cells contain a red pigment in the vacuoles. A student cut some cubes (1 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm) from a beetroot and washed them in running water for 20 minutes. The cubes were then put into test tubes containing distilled water and alcohol of different concentrations (W, X, Y and Z) for 30 minutes. The table below shows the colour intensity of the solutions after 30 minutes.
Solution

(Key: ‘+’ means that the solution is red in colour. The larger the number of ‘+’, the more intense the colour. ‘–’ means that the solution is colourless)
Which alcohol is highest in concentration?
A
 W
B
 X
C
 Y
D
 Z
Ans: C
